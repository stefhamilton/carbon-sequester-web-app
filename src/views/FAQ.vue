    <h2>What is the app purpose?</h2>
          <div><p>The purpose of this app is to provide a system that enables anyone with a camera to create evidence of carbon capture. The evidence will evaluated and if sufficient a company can purchase it as a way to offset their carbon emissions.</p>       </div>
    <h2>What certifications are there?</h2>
    <p>Currently there are none. The intent is to create a "trustless" system where the evidence of carbon capture is readily available. Fraud is expected but just like with credit cards it can be detected and stopped. The more data that we collect the easier it will be to spot and systems can be evolved. It would be better if affiliated with an org like <a href="https://www.southpole.com/sustainability-solutions/carbon-credits"> South Pole</a> or the carbon credits were certified but until data is collected there is no way to measure efficacy</p>
    <h2>Why pay people to make biochar?</h2>
    <div><p>CO2 emissions contribute to a warming planet and
      <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/30/992545255/do-carbon-offsets-actually-work-planet-money-takes-a-look"> 20% of  the largest US companies plan to go carbon neutral</a>.</p>
      <p>Reducing energy consumption will only go far. To become carbon neutral, a company can purchase carbon that someone else sequesters. Per this article <a href="https://energypost.eu/10-carbon-capture-methods-compared-costs-scalability-permanence-cleanness/">biochar</a> is one of the most cost effective ways to do that.</p>
